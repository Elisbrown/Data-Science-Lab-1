# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using a dataset from Iowa. It explores fundamental data science workflows, including data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The project compares the performance of Decision Tree and Random Forest regressors to identify the best predictive model.


## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local system.
2. Place the dataset (`iowaHousing.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
  > pip install -r requirements.txt
Type and run: 
  > python main.py
